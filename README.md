## Description
With this weeks challenge we were in charge of curating a coding quiz that is reactive to correct/incorrect answers, button clicks, and logging highscores. Using web API concepts that we learned in class such as traversing the DOM, creating event listeners, storing data in local storage, etc, I was able to create this coding quiz.
