## Description

In the CSS code given to us, there were lots of code that was repeated. To keep the code clean we were in charge of refactoring the code in order to create ease of legibility and functionality. On many CSS selectors I consolidated them into just one class because a lot of them had repeating properties. I also made some of the "div" tags into semantic html elements such as header, section and aside. In doing this challenge I found that there were numerous ways in which we could have refactored this code and there is no 100% right answer.
